# Progress: Merged Demo Application

## 1. What Works

-   **Unified Application Shell:** The application successfully runs as a single page application (SPA).
-   **Sidebar Navigation:** Users can switch between the `promptdj` and `promptdj-midi` demos using the sidebar.
-   **Demo Integration:** Both demos are encapsulated in React components and render correctly within the main application shell.
-   **Consolidated Build Process:** The project uses a single, unified `package.json` and Vite configuration.

## 2. What's Left to Build

-   No major features are left to build. The primary goal of merging the applications is complete.
-   Future work may involve further code cleanup, bug fixing, or performance optimizations.

## 3. Current Status

-   **Phase:** Implementation Complete.
-   **Completed:**
    -   Creation of the unified application shell.
    -   Refactoring of demos into components.
    -   Integration of demos into the shell.
    -   Consolidation of dependencies and build configurations.
-   **Next:** Thoroughly test the merged application and refine the documentation.

## 4. Known Issues

-   WebSocket connections were not being properly closed when switching between demo tabs. This has been addressed by ensuring the `close` event is dispatched correctly in the `PromptDjMidi` component and by improving the `close` method in the `PromptDj` and `VisionDj` components.
